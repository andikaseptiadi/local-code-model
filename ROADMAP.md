# Local Code Model - Roadmap

This document outlines planned improvements and features for the project.

## Immediate (This Week)

- [x] **Get Go Report Card Badge**
  - Submit to https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/scttfrdmn/local-code-model
  - Add A+ badge to README
  - Validates all quality work

- [x] **Add GitHub Actions CI/CD**
  - Run `make quality` on every PR/push
  - Automatically run tests
  - Ensure quality stays high as project evolves

- [x] **Add Example Outputs to README**
  - Show what the model actually generates after training
  - Include loss curves
  - Make it more tangible for learners

## Short Term (This Month)

- [x] **Add KV Cache for Inference**
  - Currently generating is slow (recomputes everything each token)
  - KV caching dramatically speeds up generation
  - Good teaching opportunity about optimization

- [x] **Create Blog Posts/Tutorials** (2/3 complete)
  - ✅ Attention mechanism deep dive ([docs/attention-mechanism.md](docs/attention-mechanism.md))
  - ✅ Backpropagation through transformers ([docs/backpropagation.md](docs/backpropagation.md))
  - [ ] Training dynamics and loss curves

- [ ] **Add Visualization Tools**
  - Attention weight visualization
  - Training loss/perplexity plots
  - Token embedding visualizations (t-SNE/UMAP)

## Medium Term (Next 3 Months)

- [ ] **BPE Tokenizer Implementation**
  - Replace character-level with proper BPE
  - Better vocabulary efficiency
  - More realistic training

- [ ] **Interactive Notebooks/Tutorials**
  - Create Jupyter notebooks (using gophernotes)
  - Step-by-step tutorials for each component
  - Make it easier to experiment

- [ ] **Implement Modern Architectural Improvements**
  - RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings)
  - SwiGLU activation
  - RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm
  - Shows evolution of transformer architecture

- [ ] **Build Community**
  - Discord/community forum
  - Place for learners to ask questions
  - Share what they've built

## Educational Enhancements

- [ ] **"Build Your Own GPT" Tutorial Series**
  - Step-by-step guide building from scratch
  - Each step is a git commit
  - Learners can follow along commit by commit

- [ ] **Add Troubleshooting Guide**
  - Common issues (NaN loss, poor convergence)
  - How to debug training problems
  - Performance tuning tips

- [ ] **Video Tutorials**
  - Walkthrough of key concepts
  - Live coding sessions
  - Architecture explanations

## Performance/Features

- [ ] **Implement Proper Causal Masking**
  - Currently implicit in generation
  - Should be explicit in attention mechanism
  - More correct architecturally

- [ ] **Gradient Accumulation**
  - Allow training with larger effective batch sizes
  - Important for memory-constrained environments

- [ ] **Add More Architecture Variants**
  - BERT-style (bidirectional)
  - Encoder-decoder (T5-style)
  - Shows different transformer architectures

- [ ] **Implement Common Optimizations**
  - Mixed precision training
  - Gradient checkpointing
  - Flash Attention (educational implementation)

## Advanced Features

- [ ] **Add Evaluation Metrics**
  - Perplexity tracking
  - BLEU/ROUGE for generation quality
  - Benchmark against reference implementations

- [ ] **Implement Training from Scratch on Real Dataset**
  - Use WikiText or similar
  - Show full training pipeline
  - Demonstrate convergence to reasonable perplexity

- [ ] **Add Model Analysis Tools**
  - Attention pattern analysis
  - Layer-wise learning rate analysis
  - Gradient flow visualization

- [ ] **Benchmarking Suite**
  - Track training speed improvements
  - Memory usage profiling
  - Compare different implementation choices
